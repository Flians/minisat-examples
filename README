Overview
================================================================================

  This is a set of examples of how to use the MiniSat API. While
  sparsely populated at the moment this is intended to serve as a sort
  of FAQ for general encoding questions, as well as MiniSat-specific
  usage issues.

Examples
================================================================================

  - Minumerate:

    This simple example gives solutions to two frequently recurring
    encoding patterns: enumerating models and finding minimal
    models. The default mode of the program is to read a CNF in DIMACS
    format and either enumerate all models, or only minimal models.

    In this example models are merely counted, but it should be fairly
    clear how to do further processing. Further, minimal models are
    defined with respect to the number of true variables. In
    applications it would be more useful to be able to define
    minimality with respect to a set of literals to allow minimizing a
    subset of variables and take polarity into account.
